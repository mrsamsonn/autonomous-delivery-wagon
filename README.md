# 🚚 Autonomous Delivery Wagon (ADW) [In Progress]

A sidewalk-friendly autonomous delivery robot designed for scalable last-mile logistics.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

The **Autonomous Delivery Wagon (ADW)** is a heavy-duty autonomous robot platform, based on a **modified garden wagon chassis**, and tailored for real-world delivery applications. Designed with affordability, modularity, and functionality in mind, ADW is engineered to carry up to **600 lbs** while navigating sidewalks and varied terrains autonomously.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- **Modified Commercial Wagon Base**  
  - Reinforced steel-frame platform  
  - Custom **axle replacement** for improved durability  
  - Integrated **350W high-torque motor** and servo system for controlled mobility

- **Advanced Perception Stack**  
  - Mounted **3D LiDAR** with **360° horizontal** and **90° vertical FOV** for robust environmental awareness  
  - **Depth camera** for object detection and tracking  
  - Real-time obstacle detection and path planning

- **Compute & Autonomy**  
  - Powered by **NVIDIA Jetson Nano**  
  - Running **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** and **ROS (Robot Operating System)** for localization and autonomous decision-making

- **Planned Capabilities**  
  - Manual control phase (for testing and calibration)  
  - Data collection for SLAM and AI model tuning  
  - Autonomous path planning and dynamic rerouting  
  - Secure delivery logic with compartment locking
